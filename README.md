# PyCRAI

This is a python library to identify rings in polycyclic molecules and 
color the rings according to its local aromaticity.
The current version of the script uses the Harmonic oscillator model of 
aromaticity (HOMA) to compute the rings' aromaticity.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need:

- python3 (tested with version 3.8.1)
- numpy
- matplotlib
